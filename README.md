## Vue Configurations 
Vue js offers a number of configuration options while creating a new project using Vue Cli. This project is using the following Configuration Options
- **Babel** - JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript that can be run by older JavaScript engines. 
- **Router** - Official Vue js router to provide client side routing for a Single Page application
    - Configured to use 'History' Mode
- **Vuex** - Vuex is a state management library for Vue.js applications. It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application
- **CSS Pre-processor** - CSS preprocessor lets you generate CSS from the preprocessor's own unique syntax - providing features such as variables, mixins which don't exist in CSS. 
    - Sass/SCSS (with node-sass) is being used in this project
- **Linter** - A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code to maintain code quality and to have consistent coding style.
    - ESLint + Airbnb configuration
    - Lint on save
- **Unit Testing** - Unit tests are automated tests written to ensure that a section of an application meets its behaviour as intended. 
    - 'Mocha' is selected as unit testing solution
 
Configuration files for Babel and ESLint are placed in the dedicated config files at the root of the project
